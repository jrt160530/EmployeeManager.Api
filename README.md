# EmployeeManager.Api

EmployeeManager.ApiClient should be used in conjuction with this (EmployeeManager.Api) api.
I had EmployeeManager.Api solution opened in Visual Studio, added the .ApiClient project to the solution, and then set the solution to be "multiple start up projects"
with the API project to start up first.

Employee Manager is a web based application used for performing CRUD operations on a list of Employees stored in a databasse (I used local DB in this case).
Entity Framework is used for the ORM.
Identity is used for the sign-in manager.
